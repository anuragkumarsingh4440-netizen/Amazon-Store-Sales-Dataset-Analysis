This project focuses on analyzing Amazon store sales data and creating an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The dataset was already in clean and structured form, so only basic EDA and preprocessing were done using Python before visualization in Power BI.

The dashboard highlights sales performance, profit trends, customer segments, product categories, and regional contributions, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.
